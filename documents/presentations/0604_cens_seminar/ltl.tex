\noindent
{\bf No Leaks.} The first property formalizes the absence of resource
leaks by enforcing that along every program execution path, every allocation
$\mathrm{alloc}\ x$ is necessarily followed by either
a free or a store of a handle
that refers to the same resource as $x$:
\[
\Box \left( (\mathrm{alloc}\ x) \rightarrow
	\Diamond \left( (\mathrm{free}\ y 
                              \vee
                        \mathrm{store}\ y) \wedge \alias(x,y) 
                 \right) \right)
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\smallskip\noindent
{\bf No Dangling Pointers.} The second
property states that once a resource has
been freed, it is never accessed again:
\[
\Box ( \mathrm{free}\ x \rightarrow \Next (\Box (\lnot (\access(y) \wedge \alias(x,y))))) 
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\smallskip\noindent
{\bf Allocation Before Use.}
The final property requires that any access to a handle is preceded by 
an allocation or retrieval from the store:
\[
\Box (\access(x) \rightarrow \PastDiamond (\alias(x,y) \wedge 
	\left[ \mathrm{alloc}\ y \vee \mathrm{get}\ y \right] ) )
\]
The $\PastDiamond$ operator is analogous to $\Diamond$ but quantifies
over all {\em predecessor} states in the execution path from the given
state, rather than successor states.
