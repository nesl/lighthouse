ctosos
------

Update static functions to take as input a void* then typecast to state
struct in body of function.

Use my own pid for pub_pid

Use my own address space for pub_fid

Use predefined sub_pid / sub_fid enums when possible


Suport Tools
------------

Pull from C file into header file:
- enums for pid / fid
- xxx_proto typedefs

Reinsert the enum names into generated code

Automate steps to go from C to SOSc


Cleaning SOS
------------

Use enum rather than #define in SOS
