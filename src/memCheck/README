INSTALL:
--------

1. Download the most recent version of CIL


2. Modify "alloc_names" in ptranal.ml to include SOS specific malloc
functions.  The updated version should read:

========
let alloc_names = 
  [
    "malloc";"calloc";"realloc";"xmalloc";"__builtin_alloca";"alloca";"kmalloc";
    "ker_malloc";"ker_msg_take_data";"sos_blk_mem_alloc";"msg_create"
  ]
========


3. Build CIL


4. Download the most recent version of "the checker" (all you need is the
memoryChecker directory)


5. Update "CIL_DIR" the Makefile to point to the directory containing the
"cil.cmxa" libraray for your installation of CIL (this is a platform and
installation specific)


6. Type "touch .depend"


7. Type "make depend"


8. Type "make"


9. Run the resulting program using:

========
$ ./memory [options] <file to examine>
========


Note: A number of debugging flags are convientent for understanding what the
checker is doing (and what is going wrong!)  Use the "--help" option to list
all flags.
