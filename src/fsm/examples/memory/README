\section overview Overview

A module that alternates between allocating a buffer for data use and freeing
that buffer.  A state variable is used to describe if the buffer is allocated
or not.  The assumption is that when the state is 1 the buffer is allocated,
and when the state is 0 the buffer is NULL.

\subsection conditions Pre- and Post-Conditions

MSG_INIT

\li Pre: s->buffer is NULL
\li Post: s->state is 0 and s->buffer is NULL

MSG_TIMER_TIMEOUT.MEMORY_TID.S0

\li Pre: s->state is 0 and s->buffer is NULL
\li Post: s->state is 1 and s->buffer is valid

MSG_TIMER_TIMEOUT.MEMORY_TID.S1

\li Pre: s->state is 1 and s->buffer is valid
\li Post: s->state is 0 and s->buffer is NULL

MSG_FINAL.S0

\li Pre: s->state is 0 and s->buffer is NULL
\li Post: s->buffer is NULL

MSG_FINAL.S1

\li Pre: s->state is 1 and s->buffer is valid
\li Post: s->buffer is NULL
